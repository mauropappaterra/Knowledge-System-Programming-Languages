<h1>A Knowledge System in Programming Languages</h1>

I've decided to create a knowledge system on every single computer language ever
conceived. I've implemented the knowledge system on SWI-Prolog, as I found it ideal for this task. This knowledge
system on every single computer language ever conceived should be act as a domain expert in
programming languages. Users should be able to query the system in order to find different languages
paradigms, platforms, application field and any other information that would contribute on choosing
the right programming language for the task.
Although I find this endeavour to be a real challenge, I am sure is not an impossible task. Nonetheless,
it would take me more than a few weeks to have it as I want it. As a result, what you see in your
computer screen right now is merely a prototype. I am sure the accuracy in the system will improve
notably, as I add more languages and more information.
